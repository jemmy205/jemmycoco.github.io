 Title: Project for frontend mentor - QR CODE CARD

Description: This is a project challange given to me by Front end mentor to build my skills. It comprises of a QR Code image that when scanned, takes you to the frontend mentor site to learn more too.
I used a visual studio code as my text editor and wrote this in the Semantic HTML markup language and CSS for styling. Also used Flexbox for professional and accurate alignment and added media queries so it can be resposive no matter the device size.
I also used some fonts from google to help my typography skills.

Usage: Just scan the QR CODE and it takes you to the frontendmentor's website where you can test your skills and build effective designs.

What I Learnt: Became very good in positioning and alignment. Also learnt about responsive web design and media queries.

Continued Development: I hope to be very good in Responsive web design and alignments coming projects
